# Analyzing-NYC-High-School-Data

The aim of this project is to explore relationships between SAT scores and demographic factors in New York City public schools. The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year. Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.

New York City has published data on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets. We will use the following data sets in this analysis:

SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City

School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City

Class size - Information on class size for each school

AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)

Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information

Demographics - Demographic information for each school

School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school

New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test.

Initial results
After initial analysis of the data, it can be noticed that the SAT scores are determining by some of the demographic factors. Some of the initial assumptions:

 - The safe schools present better results in this test, since a safe place is better for a learning environment.

 - The schools with high percentege of white and asian students achieve better results than the ones who present high percentege of black and hipanic students.

 - The gender does not present high influence in the SAT score results.
